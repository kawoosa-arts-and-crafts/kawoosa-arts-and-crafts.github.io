Although, the art of making these gorgeous rugs is not native to Kashmir and was first introduced nearly 400 years back by the Mughal rulers in India.

          <h2>KASHMIRI RUGS (CARPETS)</h2>

          <p class="product-description mt-20">
            A Kashmir rug is a hand-knotted oriental rug from Kashmir valley in India, which is associated with Kashmiri handicrafts. Kashmir rugs or carpets have intricate designs that are primarily oriental, floral style in a range of colours, sizes and quality. Kashmir carpets are handmade, hand-knotted, and are primarily made using pure wool, pure silk and occasionally wool and silk blends. These are available in wide-ranging colours, designs and sizes.Kashmir rugs are available in a range of standard sizes, such as 3'x2', 4'x2'6", 5'x3', 6'x4', 7'x5', 10'x8', 12'x9', 14'x10', 15'x12' and 18'x12'. Larger sizes than these dimensions are mostly custom-made.Kashmir rugs are renowned to have bright, jewel-like colour tones such as sapphire blue, ruby red, emerald green, aquamarine, amethyst, and ivory. Rugs from Kashmir are traditionally made in oriental, floral designs that typically involve significant and culturally important motifs such as the paisley, CHINAR tree, (the oriental plane) and tree-of-life. Most of these designs are rooted in the Kashmiri way of life and are a symbolic representation of the age-old Kashmir tradition of hospitality, warmth, and love.It is often said in Kashmir folklore that a home is incomplete without a soul - a Kashmir carpet. The ethos of Kashmir culture is often represented in the motifs of a Kashmir rug. Although, the art of making these gorgeous rugs is not native to Kashmir and was first introduced nearly 400 years back by the Mughal rulers in India. Yet the indigenous brilliance of the local crafts-persons has made Kashmir carpets one of the most sought after works of art in the world.Rugs of Kashmir have always found more appeal due to their quaint designs and an interesting blend of classic colours inspired by the cultural microcosm of Kashmir and at times the colours were contemporary in nature that made carpets of Kashmir widely popular across North America, South Asia and Europe.

                      The samovor is a memoir of the Kashmiri culture, where any occasion is rendered incomplete without a SAMOVAR brewing the robust NOON-CHAI or a heavenly cup of KEHWA. This handcrafted SAMOVAR is more than just decor. It is a piece of luxury, an explicit art form in itself which lingers on in the memories of those who set their eyes on them. Magically transformed into a classic piece of opulence, the Samovar has been conjured from remnants of waste paper by an elaborate process which begins with mashing and hardening this paper and then painting elegies in art with the help of specialized brushes. . Bring home this sumptuous pieces of home decor and let it make a statement of exclusivity within your dwelling.
