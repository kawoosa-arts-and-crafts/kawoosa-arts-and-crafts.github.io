description: The most celebrated of traditional Kashmiri handicrafts is embroidery. A special kind of embroidery done with a pointed hook used for drapery and upholstery is known as crewel. Because of the high quality of embroidery done on wall hangings and rugs, Kashmiri crewel-work is in great demand throughout the world. Crewel embroidery is a fascinating needle art. Typically done in thin wool thread on linen or cotton fabric, crewel work provides a texture not seen in silk or cotton embroidery. A special kind of embroidery done with a pointed hook used for drapery and upholstery is known as crewel. Because of the high quality of embroidery done on wall hangings and rugs, Kashmiri crewel-work is in great demand throughout the world. Crewel is basically similar to chain stitch, done on a white background, though here the motifs, mainly styled flowers, do not cover the entire surface, and the background is not embroidered upon. Wool is almost invariably used in crewel-work and colour schemes are not as elaborate as in chain stitch.
